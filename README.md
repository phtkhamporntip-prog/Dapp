## Tech Stack

| Component   | Technology             |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Frontend    | React + Vite           |
| Backend     | Firebase (Serverless)  |
| Database    | Firebase Firestore     |
| Auth        | Firebase Authentication|
| Price Feed  | CoinGecko API          |
| Deployment  | Vercel, Firebase Hosting|

**Note**: The platform previously used MongoDB + Express.js backend, which has been replaced with Firebase for better reliability, scalability, and lower maintenance. See [Backend Replacement](BACKEND_REPLACEMENT.md) for details.

**Note**: The platform uses Firebase (Serverless) - no backend API endpoints are needed for new deployments.

## Legacy API Endpoints (Deprecated)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED**: The following REST API endpoints were part of the old MongoDB backend and are no longer recommended. Firebase provides these features through its SDK.

<details>
<summary>View Legacy API Endpoints (Not Recommended)</summary>

## 🔐 Wallet Connection System

The platform features a comprehensive multi-wallet connection system supporting **11 different wallet providers** across all platforms (desktop, mobile, dApps browsers).

### Supported Wallets

   - WalletConnect QR code for any wallet
   - Links to download official wallet apps

### Key Features

- **EIP-6963 Support**: Modern multi-wallet detection standard
- **Open Access Mode**: Users can explore without connecting wallet
- **Auto-Detection**: Identifies available wallets and in-app browsers

### For Developers

```javascript
// Using the wallet provider
import { useUniversalWallet } from '../lib/walletConnect';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    address,           // Connected wallet address
    isConnected,       // Connection status
    connectWallet,     // Connect function
    disconnect,        // Disconnect function
    environment        // Current environment info
  } = useUniversalWallet();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectWallet('metamask')}>
      Connect MetaMask
    </button>
  );
}
```

  }'
```
