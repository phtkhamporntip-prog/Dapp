## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API. See [backend README](../backend/README.md) for available endpoints.

Required environment variable:

```

## WalletConnect & TURN Server Setup

For improved WalletConnect reliability, especially behind firewalls or NAT, configure Cloudflare TURN servers:

```env
# Optional: Cloudflare TURN Server for WalletConnect
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_TURN_SERVER_NAME=your-server-name
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_TURN_TOKEN_ID=your-token-id
VITE_CLOUDFLARE_TURN_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better connection success rate through firewalls
- ✅ Improved peer-to-peer connection reliability
- ✅ Faster connection establishment

**Testing:**
1. Open `test-turn-server.html` in your browser
2. Enter your Cloudflare credentials
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify

For detailed setup instructions, see [CLOUDFLARE_TURN_SETUP.md](../CLOUDFLARE_TURN_SETUP.md)
