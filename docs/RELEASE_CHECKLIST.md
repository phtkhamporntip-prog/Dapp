## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues Summary

| Cause | Prevention/Fix |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Backend/API cold start | Paid hosting or keep-alive service |
| Bad DB connection | Whitelist IPs, monitor, optimize queries |
| Wrong API URL | Set and test frontend `.env` |
| CORS/network errors | Correct backend CORS, use valid domains |
| Heavy data loads | Paginate, lazy load in dashboard |
| Unseeded master/admin | Confirm DB seed/init for admin users |
| Missing error messages | Add user feedback in frontend |
| JWT/session issues | Always use fresh login token |

### Detailed Troubleshooting

#### 1. Backend/API Issues

**Symptoms**: Slow first load, timeouts, connection errors

**Fixes**:

- Use paid hosting plan to avoid cold starts (Render free tier sleeps)
- Check MongoDB Atlas is whitelisted and healthy
- Test `/api/health` endpoint - expect `{"status":"ok","mongoConnected":true}`
- Check backend logs on Render for errors

#### 2. Frontend Configuration

**Symptoms**: API calls fail, wrong server

**Fixes**:

- Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` points to live backend
- Rebuild and redeploy frontend after changing `.env`
- Use pagination and lazy loading for dashboard data

#### 3. CORS and Networking

**Symptoms**: Browser console shows CORS errors

**Fixes**:

- Backend must allow your frontend domain (not just `*`)
- Check server firewalls and DNS resolution
- Verify SSL certificates are valid

#### 4. Authentication Issues

**Symptoms**: Login fails, stuck loading, invalid token

**Fixes**:

- Confirm database seed ran and master/admin accounts exist
- Clear localStorage and try fresh login
- Check JWT token hasn't expired
- Avoid multiple logins in different tabs

#### 5. Browser Tips

- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear site data: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
- Check console for errors: `F12` → Console tab
